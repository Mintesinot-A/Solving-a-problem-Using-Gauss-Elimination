# Solving-an-Engineering-Problem-Using-Gauss-Elimination
A number of engineeing problems appear to be sequences of linear equations. Linear equations can be solved by using Gauss elimination process. Gauss elimination technique works only for square matrices.
This repository presents how Gauss elimination is applied to solve engineering problems such as the one that have been dealt in this repository. The basic working procedures of Gauss elimination method in Python is available here. ---> https://github.com/SamuelGetachew2121/Gauss-Elimination-Solver-for-Linear-Equations
